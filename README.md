# bagels.py
code idea from the book The Big Book of Small Python Projects: 81 Easy Practice Programs by Al Sweigart.
Turns out the code solution was easy. guess i overcomplicated it lol

a game where players have to guess a secret three-digit code based on clues (like mastermind)
it gives clues based on the user's choice: "pico" if one digit is correct but in the wrong position, "fermi" if one digit is correct and in the correct position, and "bagels" if there are no correct digits

the users is given 10 tries to guess the code
